Webapp built using FastAPI in the backend, a PostgreSQL database, Kafka brokers, and React.js for the frontend. Provides a easy-to-understand UI that allows users to check freshly updated stock by the minute for various different companies. Different functions also allow users to quickly receive and analyze live market updates, including getting the most recent update for any stock, scheduling a background task to store market data, getting the most recent 5 average opening prices for any stock, or viewing the change in market opening prices over the past 5 days. Future tasks include further analysis functions (not only on the opening price), possible modeling and predictions/suggestions, and further visualizations.
